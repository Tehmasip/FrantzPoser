Before you run the demo scene, follow these steps:
1. Install the Post Processing package from Package Manager
2. Set the Color Space to Linear (Edit > Project Settings > Player > Other Settings)
3. (Optional) Set Suntail settings as default (Suntail Village > Demo > Settings)

URP support is currently in development and will be available in an update soon. We also plan to add the full documentation for Suntail Village.

If you have any problems, you can email me switch101@yandex.ru.
